This details the code I wrote with a team of 4 students mostly for my intro to big data class.  The descriptions of the programs is in the code.  I will say, the files that this programs were designed to read are typically too big to include even in a zip file.  So I gues  We used a combination of Hadoop, Mahout, Machine Learning Techniques (Naive Bayes Classifiers), NLP Techniques (stemming and maybe N-grams I'm not sure (It's been a while since I coded this), but Naive Bayes for sure).
